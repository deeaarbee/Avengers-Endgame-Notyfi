# Avengers Endgame Notyfi

This was a simple python script that 
I wrote to notify me when the theatre opens their online booking for Avengers Endgame.

I was very excited to watch it on the first day of its release. But the sad part was that I was in my project review session at college when I got the notification :(. 

But I did watch the movie on the first day :D
